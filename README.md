# INFOVIS_FirstProject
First project for the course of __Information Visualization__ at _Universit√† degli Studi Roma Tre_. The project consist in using JavaScipt and D3.js to draw 10 mosquitos. These mosquitos have to move in the drawing board on pressing 'x' key, forming a different configuration (the possible configurations are 10) and by clicking a mosquito with the left button, it's killed and it doesn't move anymore (it's important to precisely click bla with the cursor tip).
